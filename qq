[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.

       See [1mgittutorial[22m(7) to get started, then see [1mgiteveryday[22m(7) for a useful minimum set of commands. The [34m[1mGit Userâ€™s Manual[0m[1m[22m[1] has a more in-depth introduction.

       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command". [1mgitcli[22m(7) manual
       page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.

       A formatted and hyperlinked copy of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at [1mhttps://git.github.io/htmldocs/git.html[22m.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       --version
           Prints the Git suite version that the [4mgit[24m program came from.

       --help
           Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands. If the option [1m--all [22mor [1m-a [22mis given then all available commands are printed. If a Git command is named this option will bring up
           the manual page for that command.

           Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed. See [1mgit-help[22m(1) for more information, because [1mgit --help ...  [22mis converted internally into [1mgit help ...[22m.

       -C <path>
           Run as if git was started in [4m<path>[24m instead of the current working directory. When multiple [1m-C [22moptions are given, each subsequent non-absolute [1m-C <path> [22mis interpreted relative to the preceding
           [1m-C <path>[22m.

           This option affects options that expect path name like [1m--git-dir [22mand [1m--work-tree [22min that their interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the [1m-C[0m
           option. For example the following invocations are equivalent:

               git --git-dir=a.git --work-tree=b -C c status
               git --git-dir=c/a.git --work-tree=c/b status

       -c <name>=<value>
           Pass a configuration parameter to the command. The value given will override values from configuration files. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by [4mgit[24m [4mconfig[24m (subkeys separated
           by dots).

           Note that omitting the [1m= [22min [1mgit -c foo.bar ...  [22mis allowed and sets [1mfoo.bar [22mto the boolean true value (just like [1m[foo]bar [22mwould in a config file). Including the equals but with an empty value
           (like [1mgit -c foo.bar= ...[22m) sets [1mfoo.bar [22mto the empty string which [1mgit config --bool [22mwill convert to [1mfalse[22m.

       --exec-path[=<path>]
           Path to wherever your core Git programs are installed. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable. If no path is given, [4mgit[24m will print the current setting and
           then exit.

       --html-path
           Print the path, without trailing slash, where Gitâ€™s HTML documentation is installed and exit.

       --man-path
           Print the manpath (see [1mman(1)[22m) for the man pages for this version of Git and exit.

       --info-path
           Print the path where the Info files documenting this version of Git are installed and exit.

       -p, --paginate
           Pipe all output into [4mless[24m (or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is a terminal. This overrides the [1mpager.<cmd> [22mconfiguration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below).

       --no-pager
           Do not pipe Git output into a pager.

       --git-dir=<path>
           Set the path to the repository. This can also be controlled by setting the [1mGIT_DIR [22menvironment variable. It can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory.

       --work-tree=<path>
           Set the path to the working tree. It can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable
           and the core.worktree configuration variable (see core.worktree in [1mgit-config[22m(1) for a more detailed discussion).

       --namespace=<path>
           Set the Git namespace. See [1mgitnamespaces[22m(7) for more details. Equivalent to setting the [1mGIT_NAMESPACE [22menvironment variable.

       --super-prefix=<path>
           Currently for internal use only. Set a prefix which gives a path from above a repository down to its root. One use is to give submodules context about the superproject that invoked it.

       --bare
           Treat the repository as a bare repository. If GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the current working directory.

       --no-replace-objects
           Do not use replacement refs to replace Git objects. See [1mgit-replace[22m(1) for more information.

       --literal-pathspecs
           Treat pathspecs literally (i.e. no globbing, no pathspec magic). This is equivalent to setting the [1mGIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS [22menvironment variable to [1m1[22m.

       --glob-pathspecs
           Add "glob" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the [1mGIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS [22menvironment variable to [1m1[22m. Disabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic
           ":(literal)"

       --noglob-pathspecs
           Add "literal" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the [1mGIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS [22menvironment variable to [1m1[22m. Enabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic
           ":(glob)"

       --icase-pathspecs
           Add "icase" magic to all pathspec. This is equivalent to setting the [1mGIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS [22menvironment variable to [1m1[22m.

[1mLOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)[0m
       Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about [1mgit-[0m
       [1mupdate-index[22m(1) and [1mgit-read-tree[22m(1).

       The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for
       scripted use. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user experience.

       The following description divides the low-level commands into commands that manipulate objects (in the repository, index, and working tree), commands that interrogate and compare objects, and
       commands that move objects and references between repositories.

[1mCONFIGURATION MECHANISM[0m
       Git uses a simple text format to store customizations that are per repository and are per user. Such a configuration file may look like this:

           #
           # A '#' or ';' character indicates a comment.
           #

           ; core variables
           [core]
                   ; Don't trust file modes
                   filemode = false

           ; user identity
           [user]
                   name = "Junio C Hamano"
                   email = "gitster@pobox.com"

       Various commands read from the configuration file and adjust their operation accordingly. See [1mgit-config[22m(1) for a list and more details about the configuration mechanism.

[1mIDENTIFIER TERMINOLOGY[0m
       <object>
           Indicates the object name for any type of object.

       <blob>
           Indicates a blob object name.

       <tree>
           Indicates a tree object name.

       <commit>
           Indicates a commit object name.

       <tree-ish>
           Indicates a tree, commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <tree-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <tree> object but automatically dereferences <commit> and <tag> objects
           that point at a <tree>.

       <commit-ish>
           Indicates a commit or tag object name. A command that takes a <commit-ish> argument ultimately wants to operate on a <commit> object but automatically dereferences <tag> objects that point at a
           <commit>.

       <type>
           Indicates that an object type is required. Currently one of: [1mblob[22m, [1mtree[22m, [1mcommit[22m, or [1mtag[22m.

       <file>
           Indicates a filename - almost always relative to the root of the tree structure [1mGIT_INDEX_FILE [22mdescribes.

[1mSYMBOLIC IDENTIFIERS[0m
       Any Git command accepting any <object> can also use the following symbolic notation:

       HEAD
           indicates the head of the current branch.

       <tag>
           a valid tag [4mname[24m (i.e. a [1mrefs/tags/<tag> [22mreference).

       <head>
           a valid head [4mname[24m (i.e. a [1mrefs/heads/<head> [22mreference).

[1mTERMINOLOGY[0m
       Please see [1mgitglossary[22m(7).

[1mENVIRONMENT VARIABLES[0m
       Various Git commands use the following environment variables:

   [1mThe Git Repository[0m
       These environment variables apply to [4mall[24m core Git commands. Nb: it is worth noting that they may be used/overridden by SCMS sitting above Git so take care if using a foreign front-end.

       [1mGIT_INDEX_FILE[0m
           This environment allows the specification of an alternate index file. If not specified, the default of [1m$GIT_DIR/index [22mis used.

       [1mGIT_INDEX_VERSION[0m
           This environment variable allows the specification of an index version for new repositories. It wonâ€™t affect existing index files. By default index file version 2 or 3 is used. See [1mgit-update-[0m
           [1mindex[22m(1) for more information.

       [1mGIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY[0m
           If the object storage directory is specified via this environment variable then the sha1 directories are created underneath - otherwise the default [1m$GIT_DIR/objects [22mdirectory is used.

       [1mGIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES[0m
           Due to the immutable nature of Git objects, old objects can be archived into shared, read-only directories. This variable specifies a ":" separated (on Windows ";" separated) list of Git object
           directories which can be used to search for Git objects. New objects will not be written to these directories.

               Entries that begin with `"` (double-quote) will be interpreted
               as C-style quoted paths, removing leading and trailing
               double-quotes and respecting backslash escapes. E.g., the value
               `"path-with-\"-and-:-in-it":vanilla-path` has two paths:
               `path-with-"-and-:-in-it` and `vanilla-path`.

       [1mGIT_DIR[0m
           If the [1mGIT_DIR [22menvironment variable is set then it specifies a path to use instead of the default [1m.git [22mfor the base of the repository. The [1m--git-dir [22mcommand-line option also sets this value.

       [1mGIT_WORK_TREE[0m
           Set the path to the root of the working tree. This can also be controlled by the [1m--work-tree [22mcommand-line option and the core.worktree configuration variable.

       [1mGIT_NAMESPACE[0m
           Set the Git namespace; see [1mgitnamespaces[22m(7) for details. The [1m--namespace [22mcommand-line option also sets this value.

       [1mGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES[0m
           This should be a colon-separated list of absolute paths. If set, it is a list of directories that Git should not chdir up into while looking for a repository directory (useful for excluding
           slow-loading network directories). It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the environment. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this
           list and resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory. However, if even this access is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git
           that the subsequent entries are not symlinks and neednâ€™t be resolved; e.g., [1mGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES=/maybe/symlink::/very/slow/non/symlink[22m.

       [1mGIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM[0m
           When run in a directory that does not have ".git" repository directory, Git tries to find such a directory in the parent directories to find the top of the working tree, but by default it does
           not cross filesystem boundaries. This environment variable can be set to true to tell Git not to stop at filesystem boundaries. Like [1mGIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES[22m, this will not affect an explicit
           repository directory set via [1mGIT_DIR [22mor on the command line.

       [1mGIT_COMMON_DIR[0m
           If this variable is set to a path, non-worktree files that are normally in $GIT_DIR will be taken from this path instead. Worktree-specific files such as HEAD or index are taken from $GIT_DIR.
           See [1mgitrepository-layout[22m(5) and [1mgit-worktree[22m(1) for details. This variable has lower precedence than other path variables such as GIT_INDEX_FILE, GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY...

   [1mGit Commits[0m
       [1mGIT_AUTHOR_NAME[22m, [1mGIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL[22m, [1mGIT_AUTHOR_DATE[22m, [1mGIT_COMMITTER_NAME[22m, [1mGIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL[22m, [1mGIT_COMMITTER_DATE[22m, [4mEMAIL[0m
           see [1mgit-commit-tree[22m(1)

   [1mGit Diffs[0m
       [1mGIT_DIFF_OPTS[0m
           Only valid setting is "--unified=??" or "-u??" to set the number of context lines shown when a unified diff is created. This takes precedence over any "-U" or "--unified" option value passed on
           the Git diff command line.

       [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF[0m
           When the environment variable [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22mis set, the program named by it is called, instead of the diff invocation described above. For a path that is added, removed, or modified,
           [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22mis called with 7 parameters:

               path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode

           where:

       <old|new>-file
           are files GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF can use to read the contents of <old|new>,

       <old|new>-hex
           are the 40-hexdigit SHA-1 hashes,

       <old|new>-mode
           are the octal representation of the file modes.

           The file parameters can point at the userâ€™s working file (e.g.  [1mnew-file [22min "git-diff-files"), [1m/dev/null [22m(e.g.  [1mold-file [22mwhen a new file is added), or a temporary file (e.g.  [1mold-file [22min the
           index).  [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22mshould not worry about unlinking the temporary file --- it is removed when [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22mexits.

           For a path that is unmerged, [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22mis called with 1 parameter, <path>.

           For each path [1mGIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF [22mis called, two environment variables, [1mGIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER [22mand [1mGIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL [22mare set.

       [1mGIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER[0m
           A 1-based counter incremented by one for every path.

       [1mGIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL[0m
           The total number of paths.

   [1mother[0m
       [1mGIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY[0m
           A number controlling the amount of output shown by the recursive merge strategy. Overrides merge.verbosity. See [1mgit-merge[22m(1)

       [1mGIT_PAGER[0m
           This environment variable overrides [1m$PAGER[22m. If it is set to an empty string or to the value "cat", Git will not launch a pager. See also the [1mcore.pager [22moption in [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       [1mGIT_EDITOR[0m
           This environment variable overrides [1m$EDITOR [22mand [1m$VISUAL[22m. It is used by several Git commands when, on interactive mode, an editor is to be launched. See also [1mgit-var[22m(1) and the [1mcore.editor [22moption
           in [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       [1mGIT_SSH[22m, [1mGIT_SSH_COMMAND[0m
           If either of these environment variables is set then [4mgit[24m [4mfetch[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mpush[24m will use the specified command instead of [4mssh[24m when they need to connect to a remote system. The command will be given
           exactly two or four arguments: the [4musername@host[24m (or just [4mhost[24m) from the URL and the shell command to execute on that remote system, optionally preceded by [1m-p [22m(literally) and the [4mport[24m from the
           URL when it specifies something other than the default SSH port.

           [1m$GIT_SSH_COMMAND [22mtakes precedence over [1m$GIT_SSH[22m, and is interpreted by the shell, which allows additional arguments to be included.  [1m$GIT_SSH [22mon the other hand must be just the path to a program
           (which can be a wrapper shell script, if additional arguments are needed).

           Usually it is easier to configure any desired options through your personal [1m.ssh/config [22mfile. Please consult your ssh documentation for further details.

       [1mGIT_SSH_VARIANT[0m
           If this environment variable is set, it overrides Gitâ€™s autodetection whether [1mGIT_SSH[22m/[1mGIT_SSH_COMMAND[22m/[1mcore.sshCommand [22mrefer to OpenSSH, plink or tortoiseplink. This variable overrides the config
           setting [1mssh.variant [22mthat serves the same purpose.

       [1mGIT_ASKPASS[0m
           If this environment variable is set, then Git commands which need to acquire passwords or passphrases (e.g. for HTTP or IMAP authentication) will call this program with a suitable prompt as
           command-line argument and read the password from its STDOUT. See also the [1mcore.askPass [22moption in [1mgit-config[22m(1).

       [1mGIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT[0m
           If this environment variable is set to [1m0[22m, git will not prompt on the terminal (e.g., when asking for HTTP authentication).

       [1mGIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM[0m
           Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide [1m$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig [22mfile. This environment variable can be used along with [1m$HOME [22mand [1m$XDG_CONFIG_HOME [22mto create a predictable
           environment for a picky script, or you can set it temporarily to avoid using a buggy [1m/etc/gitconfig [22mfile while waiting for someone with sufficient permissions to fix it.

       [1mGIT_FLUSH[0m
           If this environment variable is set to "1", then commands such as [4mgit[24m [4mblame[24m (in incremental mode), [4mgit[24m [4mrev-list[24m, [4mgit[24m [4mlog[24m, [4mgit[24m [4mcheck-attr[24m and [4mgit[24m [4mcheck-ignore[24m will force a flush of the output
           stream after each record have been flushed. If this variable is set to "0", the output of these commands will be done using completely buffered I/O. If this environment variable is not set, Git
           will choose buffered or record-oriented flushing based on whether stdout appears to be redirected to a file or not.

       [1mGIT_TRACE[0m
           Enables general trace messages, e.g. alias expansion, built-in command execution and external command execution.

           If this variable is set to "1", "2" or "true" (comparison is case insensitive), trace messages will be printed to stderr.

           If the variable is set to an integer value greater than 2 and lower than 10 (strictly) then Git will interpret this value as an open file descriptor and will try to write the trace messages into
           this file descriptor.

           Alternatively, if the variable is set to an absolute path (starting with a [4m/[24m character), Git will interpret this as a file path and will try to write the trace messages into it.

           Unsetting the variable, or setting it to empty, "0" or "false" (case insensitive) disables trace messages.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_PACK_ACCESS[0m
           Enables trace messages for all accesses to any packs. For each access, the pack file name and an offset in the pack is recorded. This may be helpful for troubleshooting some pack-related
           performance problems. See [1mGIT_TRACE [22mfor available trace output options.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_PACKET[0m
           Enables trace messages for all packets coming in or out of a given program. This can help with debugging object negotiation or other protocol issues. Tracing is turned off at a packet starting
           with "PACK" (but see [1mGIT_TRACE_PACKFILE [22mbelow). See [1mGIT_TRACE [22mfor available trace output options.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_PACKFILE[0m
           Enables tracing of packfiles sent or received by a given program. Unlike other trace output, this trace is verbatim: no headers, and no quoting of binary data. You almost certainly want to
           direct into a file (e.g., [1mGIT_TRACE_PACKFILE=/tmp/my.pack[22m) rather than displaying it on the terminal or mixing it with other trace output.

           Note that this is currently only implemented for the client side of clones and fetches.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_PERFORMANCE[0m
           Enables performance related trace messages, e.g. total execution time of each Git command. See [1mGIT_TRACE [22mfor available trace output options.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_SETUP[0m
           Enables trace messages printing the .git, working tree and current working directory after Git has completed its setup phase. See [1mGIT_TRACE [22mfor available trace output options.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_SHALLOW[0m
           Enables trace messages that can help debugging fetching / cloning of shallow repositories. See [1mGIT_TRACE [22mfor available trace output options.

       [1mGIT_TRACE_CURL[0m
           Enables a curl full trace dump of all incoming and outgoing data, including descriptive information, of the git transport protocol. This is similar to doing curl [1m--trace-ascii [22mon the command
           line. This option overrides setting the [1mGIT_CURL_VERBOSE [22menvironment variable. See [1mGIT_TRACE [22mfor available trace output options.

       [1mGIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS[0m
           Setting this variable to [1m1 [22mwill cause Git to treat all pathspecs literally, rather than as glob patterns. For example, running [1mGIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS=1 git log -- '*.c' [22mwill search for commits
           that touch the path [1m*.c[22m, not any paths that the glob [1m*.c [22mmatches. You might want this if you are feeding literal paths to Git (e.g., paths previously given to you by [1mgit ls-tree[22m, [1m--raw [22mdiff
           output, etc).

       [1mGIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS[0m
           Setting this variable to [1m1 [22mwill cause Git to treat all pathspecs as glob patterns (aka "glob" magic).

       [1mGIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS[0m
           Setting this variable to [1m1 [22mwill cause Git to treat all pathspecs as literal (aka "literal" magic).

       [1mGIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS[0m
           Setting this variable to [1m1 [22mwill cause Git to treat all pathspecs as case-insensitive.

       [1mGIT_REFLOG_ACTION[0m
           When a ref is updated, reflog entries are created to keep track of the reason why the ref was updated (which is typically the name of the high-level command that updated the ref), in addition to
           the old and new values of the ref. A scripted Porcelain command can use set_reflog_action helper function in [1mgit-sh-setup [22mto set its name to this variable when it is invoked as the top level
           command by the end user, to be recorded in the body of the reflog.

       [1mGIT_REF_PARANOIA[0m
           If set to [1m1[22m, include broken or badly named refs when iterating over lists of refs. In a normal, non-corrupted repository, this does nothing. However, enabling it may help git to detect and abort
           some operations in the presence of broken refs. Git sets this variable automatically when performing destructive operations like [1mgit-prune[22m(1). You should not need to set it yourself unless you
           want to be paranoid about making sure an operation has touched every ref (e.g., because you are cloning a repository to make a backup).

       [1mGIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL[0m
           If set to a colon-separated list of protocols, behave as if [1mprotocol.allow [22mis set to [1mnever[22m, and each of the listed protocols has [1mprotocol.<name>.allow [22mset to [1malways [22m(overriding any existing
           configuration). In other words, any protocol not mentioned will be disallowed (i.e., this is a whitelist, not a blacklist). See the description of [1mprotocol.allow [22min [1mgit-config[22m(1) for more
           details.

       [1mGIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER[0m
           Set to 0 to prevent protocols used by fetch/push/clone which are configured to the [1muser [22mstate. This is useful to restrict recursive submodule initialization from an untrusted repository or for
           programs which feed potentially-untrusted URLS to git commands. See [1mgit-config[22m(1) for more details.

[1mDISCUSSION[0m
       More detail on the following is available from the [34m[1mGit concepts chapter of the user-manual[0m[1m[22m[2] and [1mgitcore-tutorial[22m(7).

       A Git project normally consists of a working directory with a ".git" subdirectory at the top level. The .git directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing the
       complete history of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads.

       The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each
       reference a single tree and some number of parent commits.

       The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in the projectâ€™s history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step. Commits with more
       than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development.

       All objects are named by the SHA-1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits. Such names are globally unique. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for
       by signing just that commit. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose.

       When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files".

       Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history. A ref may contain the SHA-1 name of an object or the name of another ref. Refs with names beginning [1mref/head/ [22mcontain the SHA-1 name of
       the most recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development. SHA-1 names of tags of interest are stored under [1mref/tags/[22m. A special ref named [1mHEAD [22mcontains the name of the currently checked-out
       branch.

       The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set of attributes. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current
       branch. The attributes (last modified time, size, etc.) are taken from the corresponding file in the working tree. Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these attributes.
       The index may be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the content stored in the index.

       The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname. These stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress.
